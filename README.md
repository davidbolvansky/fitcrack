# RELEASE 2.4.0 IS HERE!
After two years and six months, a new stable release is finally here! See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

**The installation has never been easier:** Fitcrack is now available as a pre-built Docker image on Docker Hub. See [Docker install README](INSTALL-Docker.md) for details.

# Fitcrack (Distributed password cracking system)

Fitcrack is a [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu)-based [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/)-powered distributed password cracking system.
It recovers passwords that protect various encrypted media like documents, archives, or disk volumes, breaks
various application passwords, as well as raw or salted cryptographic hashes.
You can use our system to crack more than [350 different algorithms](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/#features-algos) supported by hashcat.
Fitcrack allows you to distribute your tasks over dozens of different GPU-equipped computing nodes with Linux, Windows OS or macOS.
For controlling your cracking network and management of jobs, you can use our friendly
[Web](https://nesfit.github.io/fitcrack/#/) interface, or communicate directly with our REST API.

A detailed documentation and other information can be found at [https://fitcrack.fit.vutbr.cz](https://fitcrack.fit.vutbr.cz).

### Clone Fitcrack repository with submodules
Run ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/davidbolvansky/fitcrack``


<a name="inst"></a>
## Installation
Since Fitcrack 2.4.0, [Docker](INSTALL-Docker.md) is the recommended method
for deployment. Everything is shipped in a single container. It also has a native
support for SSL/TLS which is now super-easy to configure.
Nevertheless, you can still use the installer or manual install if you want.

See instructions the desired type of deployment:
* [Installation using a custom Docker build](INSTALL-Docker.md) (make your own build of Fitcrack)
* [Installation using Installer](INSTALL-Installer.md) (working alternative)
* [Manual installation](INSTALL-Manual.md) (for advanced users/modders)


<a name="oper"></a>
## Operating the server

### Fitcrack
The **default** login credentials to the Fitcrack are:
* login: ``fitcrack``
* password: ``FITCRACK``

In the Docker-based version, those defaults can be changed by modifying the
`FITCRACK_LOGIN` and `FITCRACK_PW` variables in your `.env` file.

To learn how to use Fitcrack, check our [Fitcrack user guide](https://nesfit.github.io/fitcrack/#/).

### Server daemons
Fitcrack provides an init script can automatically starts all the server
daemons, and can be also used for stopping or restarting them.
In the Docker-based version, the script is automatically set up inside the
Fitcrack server container. With installer-based deployement, you will be asked
whether you wish to add Fitcrack as a system service.

To control the server daemons, inside your Docker container
(or on the machine where you installed Fitcrack), type:
```
service fitcrack [start|stop|status|restart]
```

For non-Docker systemd-based deployments, you can also use:
```
systemctl [start|stop|status|restart] fitcrack
```

It is also possible to operate the server daemons manually
by logging as the BOINC user (e.g. `boincadm`), descending into the
project directory (e.g. `/home/boincadm/project/fitcrack`) and running
one of the following:
* `./bin/start`
* `./bin/stop`
* `./bin/status`
* `./bin/restart`

<a name="hostconf"></a>
### Advanced: Host specific configuration
Sometimes you need to configure specific behavior for individual hosts.

Fitcrack allows you to define additional **host-specific hashcat arguments**.
This gives you options to select what GPUs to use for cracking,
configure the workload profile for fine-tuning of the performance, etc.
Simply create a file `/etc/fitcrack.conf` (Linux/macOS hosts) or
`C:\ProgramData\BOINC\fitcrack.conf` (Windows hosts).
If the file exists and is readable for the BOINC client user, the
**Agent** subsystem will append the content of 'extra_hashcat_args' to
**hashcat's arguments**.

#### Example
```
$ echo 'extra_hashcat_args=-w 4 -d 1,2 --force' > /etc/fitcrack.conf
```
Hashcat will use OpenCL devices 1 and 2. The workload profile will be set to level 4 (Nightmare).
The cracking session will be forced and all warnings ignored.

----

Fitcrack also allows you to use **prestored dictionaries on hosts**, so they do not have to be transfered
from server to hosts.

#### Example
```
$ echo 'prestored_dicts_path=/etc/fitcrack' > /etc/fitcrack.conf
```

Fitcrack client (Agent) will search for prestored dictionaries in /etc/fitcrack. So for example,
if you use rockyou.txt for this job, copy rockyou.txt to /etc/fitcrack. Please also ensure that
/etc/fitcrack is readable for BOINC. Run:

```
$ sudo chmod -R 755 /etc/fitcrack
```
