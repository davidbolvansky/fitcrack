name = Base Structure
comments = Standard base structures as defined by the original PCFG Paper, with some renaming to prevent naming collisions. Examples are A4D2 from the training word "pass12"

function = Shadow
name = A
comments = (A)lpha letter replacements for base structure. Aka "pass12" = A4D2, so this is the A4. Note, this is encoding specific so non-ASCII characters may be considered alpha. For example Cyrillic characters will be considered alpha characters

file_type = Length
function = Copy
